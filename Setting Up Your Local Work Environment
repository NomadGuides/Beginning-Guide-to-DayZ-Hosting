How-To Create A Vanilla DayZ SA Server

If you’re going to create your own DayZ SA Server on windows (vm or dedicated server), you should be able to:

    find your way around a windows directory structure.
    open ports on the windows firewall
    open/forward ports on your router (if hosted locally)
    create/run a simple batch(.BAT) file
    find and edit various configuration files (mostly XML and JSON), when making configuration changes.

I suggest reading How-To Add Mods To A DayZ SA Server and How-To Customize A DayZ SA Server.

One nice thing about DayZ SA (I’ll just call it DayZ from now on) is that setting up a server is very easy. DayZ is self-contained and doesn’t require installation of an external database (unlike A2:DayZMod).
SUPER QUICK NON-INSTALLATION

    Download DayZ Server from Steam -> Library -> Tools
        Bohemia does not require you to own a second copy or DayZ nor create another steam account to run a server.
        Note that DayZ Server Experimental is a separate download and can be installed similarly
    Edit C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer\serverDZ.cfg (default location)
        Change the hostname variable to the name of your server. Hostname is the name that shows up in the server browser. It can be a maximum of 63 characters long.
            hostname=”MyServerName”;
    Right click on DayZ Server->Properties, in the General tab, in Launch Options, add :
        -config=serverDZ.cfg -profiles=profile
    Press OK, then Close
    If you want to login to this server from another PC or outside your network, then add INBOUND rules to the windows firewall and if needed, to the router to open and forward the following default ports
        2302, 27016 (both UDP only)
    Right click on DayZ Server -> Launch OR if you want to get fancy you can create a file called start_dayzserver.bat, paste the following block into it,  edit as necessary and then double-click on it to run.

@echo off
:start
::Server name [!EDIT THIS!]
set serverName=EXAMPLE NAME
::Server files location [DEFAULT !EDIT AS NEEDED!]
set serverDirectory="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer"
::Server Port [DEFAULT]
set serverPort=2302
::Server config [DEFAULT. hostname= in serverDZ.cfg is what shows in the steam server browser. !EDIT AS NEEDED!.]
set serverConfig=serverDZ.cfg
::Server profile location. logfiles are written here and mods are configured here [DEFAULT]
set serverProfile=profile
::Logical CPU cores to use (Equal or less than available)
set serverCPU=4
::modlist should be of the form "-mod=@mod1;@mod2;@mod3;"
set modList="-mod="
::Sets title for terminal (DONT edit)
title %serverName% batch
::DayZServer location (DONT edit)
cd /D "%serverDirectory%"
:: makes the profile directory if it doesn't already exist
if not exist "%serverProfile%" ( 
mkdir %serverProfile% > nul
) 
echo (%time%) %serverName% started.
::Launch parameters (edit end: -config=|-port=|-profiles=|-doLogs|-adminLog|-netLog|-freezeCheck|-filePatching|-BEpath=|-cpuCount=)
start "DayZ Server" /min DayZServer_x64.exe -config=%serverConfig% -port=%serverPort% -profiles=%serverProfile% -BEpath=battleye %modList% -cpuCount=%serverCPU% -dologs -adminlog -netlog -freezecheck

::Time in seconds before kill server process (14400 = 4 hours)
timeout 14400
taskkill /im DayZServer_x64.exe /F
::Time in seconds to wait before..
timeout 10
::Go back to the top and repeat the whole cycle again
goto start

FULL INSTALLATION

    Download DayZ Server from Steam -> Library -> Tools
        Note that DayZ Server Experimental is a separate download and can be installed similarly
        By default, the files will be in  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer
        Copy this directory to another location. Why? Because steam will auto-update for the next release in the original location and overwrite any changes you have made. For simplicity of this documentation, I will use C:\dayzserver\ and will call it <server_root>.
    Set server configuration parameters by editing <server_root>\serverDZ.cfg
        Change the hostname variable to the name of your server. Hostname is the name that shows up in the server browser. It can be a maximum of 63 characters long.
            hostname=”MyServerName”;
        Set a password if desired
            password = “MyServerPassword”;
        Set steamQueryport ONLY if needed due to a port conflict (usually not needed)
            steamQueryPort = 27016; // default
    If you are setting up RCON access, for tools such as BEC, BattleMetrics, Dart, CF, etc add hte RCON port by editing or creating <server_root>\battleye\BEServer_x64.cfg
        Note: the filename may have extra characters appended if you’ve already run the server.
        Any unused port can be used, but avoid gameport+2,3,4. Put the following text in that file.
            RConPort 2322
    Set game port on the command line using -port=<game_port>. 2302 is the default.
        -port=2302
    Add INBOUND rules to the windows firewall to allow gameport and steamqueryport (UDP) They are at 2302 & 27016 by default unless you’ve changed them.  If you are hosting locally, you’ll most likely need to forward the same ports in your router to the host pc.
    Run the server via this command line or within a batch(.BAT) file
        Command line params documentation  – https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Server_Configuration
        Notice that the -mod, -profiles and -config commandline parameters are wrapped in double quotes. These are required if any of the directory names have spaces or special characters.

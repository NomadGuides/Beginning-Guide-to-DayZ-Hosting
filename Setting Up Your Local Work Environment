DOWNLOAD DAYZ SERVER:
BEFORE GETTING STARTED IT'S HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DOWNLOAD A TEXT EDITOR SUCH AS VSCode OR NOTEPAD++ AND OPEN YOUR SERVER FOLDER FROM HERE.
THIS WILL MAKE THINGS MUCH EASIER WHEN EDITING FILES.

1. Download DayZ Server from TOOLS in your Steam LIBRARY.
2. Once the download has finished navigate to: Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer

CREATE BATCH FILE:
1. Create a start batch file. Right click and create a new textfile, rename it to start.bat
2. Place start.bat file into your server folder: Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer
3. Right click on start.bat click edit, paste this data below into the file and click save.

@echo off
:start
::Server name
set serverName=My DayZ server
::Server files location
set serverLocation="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer"
::Server Port

cd "%serverLocation%"
echo (%time%) %serverName% started.
::Launch parameters (edit end: -config=|-port=|-profiles=|-doLogs|-adminLog|-netLog|-freezeCheck|-filePatching|-BEpath=|-cpuCount=)
start "DayZ Server" /min "DayZServer_x64.exe" -config=%serverConfig% -port=%serverPort% -cpuCount=%serverCPU% -dologs -adminlog -netlog -freezecheck
::Time in seconds before kill server process (14400 = 4 hours)
timeout 14390
taskkill /im DayZServer_x64.exe /F
::Time in seconds to wait before..

::Go back to the top and repeat the whole cycle again
goto start

NOTE: MAKE SURE serverLocation MATCHES THE SERVER FOLDER LOCATION ON YOUR PC.

SERVER CONFIG:
1. Copy & paste -config=serverDZ.cfg into your DayZ launch parameters.
2. Open serverDZ.cfg and edit to your preferences such as server name,
password to connect to the server, password to become a server admin, etc.
3. Go into the battleye folder and create a file called BEServer_x64.cfg
4. Add: RConPassword YOURPASSWORDHERE
5. Change YOURPASSWORDHERE into your RCon password of choice. Save the file. Your RCon password is to see server chat, ban and kick.

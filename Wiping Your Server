# Wiping the DayZ SA Server

To wipe your DayZ SA server, you have two options depending on whether you want to remove just player data or completely reset the server:

## Remove Player Data Only

To delete only player data while keeping the server's state and other configurations, remove the `players.db` file:

- **`players.db` File:**
  ```
  Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer\mpmissions\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\storage_1\players.db
  ```

## Wipe the Server Completely

To perform a full wipe of the server, including all data and configurations, delete the entire `storage_1` folder:

- **`storage_1` Folder:**
  ```
  Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer\mpmissions\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\storage_1
  ```
```

This guide outlines how to manage server data effectively based on your needs for either partial or complete wipes.

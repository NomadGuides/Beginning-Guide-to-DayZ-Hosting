# Adding Vehicle Spawn Points in DayZ Standalone

To add more vehicle spawn points to your DayZ Standalone server, follow these steps. This involves modifying server files and configuration settings rather than working directly with a database.

## 1. Access Your DayZ Standalone Server Files

- **Connect to Your Server:**
  - Use FTP or a file management tool provided by your server hosting provider to access your server files.

## 2. Modify Vehicle Spawn Points

In DayZ Standalone, vehicle spawn locations are managed through configuration files. Here’s how to add or modify spawn points:

### a. Edit the `types.xml` File

1. **Locate the `types.xml` File:**
   - Path: `mpmissions/dayzOffline.chernarusplus/` (or your specific mission file directory).

2. **Add or Update Vehicle Entries:**
   - Open the `types.xml` file and modify or add entries for vehicles. Adjust values like spawn probabilities and quantities.

   ```xml
   <type name="Car">
       <nominal>10</nominal>
       <lifetime>604800</lifetime>
       <restock>3600</restock>
       <min>2</min>
       <max>10</max>
   </type>
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - `<nominal>`: Number of vehicles of this type to be present.
     - `<restock>`: Frequency of new vehicle spawns.
     - `<min>` and `<max>`: Minimum and maximum numbers of this vehicle type.

### b. Edit the `cfgeventspawns.xml` File

1. **Locate the `cfgeventspawns.xml` File:**
   - Path: `mpmissions/` (same directory as `types.xml`).

2. **Add New Vehicle Spawn Points:**
   - Define new spawn points for vehicles.

   ```xml
   <event name="CarSpawnEvent">
       <type>car</type>
       <min>2</min>
       <max>5</max>
       <positions>
           <position name="CarSpawn1" x="1234.0" y="5678.0" z="0.0"/>
           <position name="CarSpawn2" x="1235.0" y="5679.0" z="0.0"/>
       </positions>
   </event>
   ```

   - **Explanation:**
     - `<type>`: Vehicle type to spawn.
     - `<min>` and `<max>`: Range for the number of vehicles to spawn.
     - `<positions>`: Coordinates where vehicles should spawn.

## 3. Adjust Server Configuration

1. **Locate the `serverDZ.cfg` File:**
   - Path: Server’s root directory.

2. **Configure Vehicle Spawn Settings:**
   - Adjust settings related to vehicle spawns if applicable. 

## 4. Restart the Server

- **Restart Your Server:**
  - After making changes, restart your DayZ Standalone server to apply the new spawn points and configurations.

## 5. Verify and Test

1. **Check Spawn Points:**
   - Join the server and verify that vehicles are spawning at the new locations.

2. **Ensure Validity:**
   - Confirm that the spawn points are valid and that vehicles appear correctly.

## Example Summary

Here’s a brief overview of the files involved:

- **`types.xml`**: Controls vehicle types and quantities.
- **`cfgeventspawns.xml`**: Defines specific spawn locations for vehicles.
- **`serverDZ.cfg`**: Adjusts general server settings, including vehicle spawns if necessary.

## Additional Tips

- **Backup Files:** Always create backups of configuration files before making changes.
- **Documentation:** Refer to DayZ Standalone server documentation for additional parameters and settings.
